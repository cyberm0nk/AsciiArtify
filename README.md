## Conclusion

The AsciiArtify project has successfully progressed through the initial stages:

- **Concept** — evaluated local Kubernetes options and selected **k3d**.
- **PoC** — deployed **Argo CD** on the k3d cluster and verified access to the UI.
- **MVP** — demonstrated a working GitOps workflow where applications are deployed and synchronized automatically from GitHub.

This confirms that our chosen stack (k3d + Argo CD) provides a solid foundation for future development and scaling of AsciiArtify.
